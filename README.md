<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `snowdl` is to make it easy to download snow data (*e.g.*,
snow depth, snow density, snow-water equivalent) from various sources
(see below).

## Installation

Install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/bsmity13/snowdl) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bsmity13/snowdl")
```

This package is not yet operational. Check back soon for progress\!

## Important Notes

  - Daymet is probably not a great source for SWE. Based on my reading,
    they treat it more like a nuisance parameter than a quanity of
    interest. See this link for their [Snow Water Equivalent
    Clarification](https://daac.ornl.gov/DAYMET/guides/Daymet_V3_CFMosaics.html#qualityassess).
    Note, this clarification was made in reference to V3, but still
    applies based on newest literature for V4.

  - Further, Daymet has (apparently) different units for SWE than other
    sources (but not really). Daymet uses kg/m^2, while other sources
    use m (depth if snow was melted). To convert, multiply by area of
    the pixel (kg/m^2 \* m^2/1 = kg) to get mass of water, convert to
    cubic meters (1 kg = 1 L H2O = 0.001 m^3), and then get depth by
    dividing by area (m^3/1 \* 1/m^2 = m). Perhaps more useful to have
    units in mm, so again multiply by 0.001 m = 1 mm.  
    \* Note Daymet comes with lcc projection and units = m. Resolution
    is 1000 x 1000, so area is 1e6 m^2.  
    \* Therefore, conversion becomes `x * 1e6 * 0.001 * 0.001`. All
    conversions cancel and resulting units are mm.  
    \* To be clear, kg/m^2 = mm in this case.
