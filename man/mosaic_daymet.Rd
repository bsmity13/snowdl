\arguments{
\item{dir}{\verb{[character]} Directory where Daymet data are stored}

\item{days}{\verb{[integer = 1:365]} Integer(ish) vector giving the days you want
retained in the data. Defaults to all days (1:365). See note in Details.}

\item{out_dir}{\verb{[character = "data"]} Directory to save mosaicked output.}

\item{format}{\verb{[character = "raster"]} Output format of raster. Either
\code{"raster"} (.grd) or \code{"GTiff"} (.tif).}

\item{crop}{\verb{[Extent = NULL]} Optional. Extent for cropping Daymet rasters.
If \code{NULL} (default), no cropping occurs. \code{reproject} takes priority over
\code{crop} if both are specified.}

\item{reproject}{\verb{[Raster* = NULL]} Optional. Raster for reprojecting Daymet
rasters. If \code{NULL} (default), no reprojection occurs. \code{reproject} takes
priority over \code{crop} if both are specified.}

\item{method}{\verb{[character = "ngb"]} Method used to compute values if
reprojecting raster. Either "ngb" or "bilinear". Ignored if \code{reproject} is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{verbose}{\verb{[logical = TRUE]} Determines whether the user will be
notified of progress.}

\description{
Mosaic daymet tiles by year and day
}
\details{
This function takes the tiles downloaded by
\code{\link{get_daymet_swe}()} and mosaics them together by year and day.
Each Daymet NetCDF file has 365 bands corresponding to days of the year. This
function finds all the \verb{*.nc} files for each year in the folder, then
determines which bands (days) to load with the argument \code{days}, so
processing is sped up noticeably if you only specify the days you need. The
output is then saved in a single-band GeoTIFF labeled with yyyy_day in the
filename.

A note on Daymet days. During leap years, there are still only 365 bands in
the raster. December 31st is omitted during leap years.
